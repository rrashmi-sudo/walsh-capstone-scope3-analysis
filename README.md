Project Title: Strategic Optimization of Supply Chain Sustainability through Sector-Based Greenhouse Gas Emission Analysis

This repository contains the capstone project Strategic Optimization of Supply Chain Sustainability through Sector-Based Greenhouse Gas Emission Analysis, focusing on the analysis of scope3 greenhouse gas emissions. This project aims to quantify and assess indirect emissions within a company's value chain, which often represent the largest source of carbon footprint. By leaveraging data analysis techniques, the project likely processes emissions data, identifies key sources, and provides insights to support sustainability stratergies and reporting frameworks.

The analysis includes:

1. Scope 3 Emissions Analysis: Quantifies and categorizes indirect value chain emissions across relevant categories (e.g., purchased goods, transportation, waste disposal).
2. Sample Size Determination: Implements statistical methods to calculate appropriate sample sizes, ensuring that the data sampled is sufficient to draw meaningful conclusions about the total emissions footprint.
3. Metric Measures: Defines and applies key performance metrics to evaluate emissions intensity, data quality, and reduction opportunities.
4. Statistical Validation: Applies techniques to assess the confidence level and margin of error in the emissions estimates, adding credibility to the findings.
5. Visualization: Creating charts or graphs to highlight major emissions contributors.
6. Reporting Insights: Summarizing findings to aid in environmental impact decision-making.

This project serves as a pratical model for organizations seeking to enhance the accuracy and defensibility of their scope 3 inventories through sound statistical practices.
